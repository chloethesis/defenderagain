# How To Configure Jekyll Github Pages

*  The first step is to create a file called **_config.yml** and provide the source code, as shown below.


```yml
title: Your title
description: Provide a Description
show_downloads: true
google_analytics:
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
```


*  After that, create a **README.md** or **index.md** post to serve as the main page.


*  After everything is done, you just need to enter some content and design according to your wishes.
