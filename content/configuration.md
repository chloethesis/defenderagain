<a href="https://google.com/search?q=jekyll"><img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/jekyll/jekyll.png" width="100%" alt="Jekyll Logo"></a><br />

*  The first step is to create a file called **_config.yml** and provide the source code, as shown below.


```yml
title: Your title
description: Provide a Description
show_downloads: true
google_analytics:
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
```


*  After that, create a **README.md** or **index.md** post to serve as the main page.


*  After everything is done, you just need to enter some content and design according to your wishes.
