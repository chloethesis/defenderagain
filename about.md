Hello. Thanks for visiting my personal blog. Do you like software design? You are a developer and always wanted to know another pro tip for simple take away? Then stay a while and listen, I have many things to say.

I grew up in a far country, called Germany. Germans normally do not risk a lot, safety first. However, I was one of those weird Germans who decided to study **not** in Germany *but* in the Netherlands. After finishing my Bachelor degree I moved to London to work as a Software Engineer.

By the way, in my free-time I create my own games and I play games as well! [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitbrain_) to take part of my journey.
